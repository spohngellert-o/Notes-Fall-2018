### Test harnesses

Common data language

* S-expressions
* XML - a language to specify languages for documentation
* JSON

## Plan Top-Down, Build Bottom Up

### Building a house

1. Architects &rarr; brainstorm for the idea (roof line, facade, interior, etc.)
2. Plan (blueprints, ..., design/drawings)
3. Figure out constraints
4. Build
5. Find problems
6. Go back to step 2

### Software Process Models

Barry Boehm - Waterfall model

#### Waterfall

__Items from each part of the list are thrown down to the next part of the list (different team)__
1. Teams collect requirements for system
2. New team writes specifications (components, interfaces, workflows). Generally job of software architect
3. Code it
4. Test it
5. Maintain it

This was meant to be a prototype way of working, with discourse on if it worked well. Instead it was just universally adopted.

Other models: test driven development, agile development

#### 5 elements/rules
1. Idea(s) &rarr; details
2. Identify external boundary (what's in the software, what will you do, what's the interface for the software)
3. Use cases, trigger events, reactions
4. Aim for the simplest but critical prototype
5. Iterate

**Not ordered, just 5 ideas on how to think about software**
