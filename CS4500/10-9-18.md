### Decision (game) trees

Board gives you many choices to move. Visualize as tree with branches at top for move, then each move provides many builds.

                                .
                  p1 moves     /|\
                              / | \
                  p1 builds  /  |  \
                           /|\ /|\ /|\
                          / | \|||/ | \
This goes on continuously.

Strategy: Number of rounds look ahead.
