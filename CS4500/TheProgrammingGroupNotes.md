### Formal and Informal Organization

* Informal structure grows to correct and complement formal structure
	* Example: Secretary tells programmers when job is ready because she is close to the board where this is posted. This one turned out well when converted to formal, as secretary's work was decreased, programmers' needs met.
	* Example 2: Vending machines at end of work room in university cause noise. When they are moved, the need for formal help increases, as students aren't helping each other at the vending machines.

* Informal structures always exist, and it is dangerous to change things without a complete understanding.

### Physical Environment and Social Organization
	
* Common space can be very important for exchanging information informally.
* Moving people can cause communication problems.

### Error and Ego

* Most programmers think of programming as something done alone.
* 3 personality directions: "compliant" (likes to work with others, be helpful), "aggressive" (money and prestige), "detatched" (left to be creative).
	* Most programmers are in the detatched camp
* **Though they are detached from people programmers are often attached to their programs**
* Programs are not as subject to taste as other detached professions (art, writing), they are more subjective in judgement
