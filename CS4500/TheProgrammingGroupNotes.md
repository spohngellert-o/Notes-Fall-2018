### Formal and Informal Organization

* Informal structure grows to correct and complement formal structure
	* Example: Secretary tells programmers when job is ready because she is close to the board where this is posted. This one turned out well when converted to formal, as secretary's work was decreased, programmers' needs met.
	* Example 2: Vending machines at end of work room in university cause noise. When they are moved, the need for formal help increases, as students aren't helping each other at the vending machines.

* Informal structures always exist, and it is dangerous to change things without a complete understanding.
