# Lesson 1

ML is a subset of AI that uses real data to automate critical tasks

## Supervised vs Unsupervised

#### Supervised
* Labeled data (output is known for training data)
* Example: Handwritten digit recognition
	* Input is pixel data
	* Output is which digit was written
	* Learning task - Find a function that takes the inputs and outputs correctly
	* Test the function on data not used in training
	* This is an example of classification
* Example: Predict price of stock at future date
	* Input is price today, history, month of  year, earnings, etc.
	* This is a regression problem (output is a numerical value, not a class).


#### Unsupervised
* Unlabeled data (output is unknown for training data)
* Example: Clustering images
	* Puts together similar images
	* Type of image not known beforehand.

## Terminology

* Hypothesis space H= {f: X -> Y}
* Training data D = (xi, yi) ∈ X x Y
* Features: xi ∈ X
* Labels: xi ∈ Y


## Bias Variance Tradeoff

* High variance if there is overfit - model works very well on training data, but not as well on testing data
	* Called high variance because model changes a lot if new data is introduced
* High bias if there was underfit - model works poorly on both training and testing data
* We want to get the sweetspot where we neither underfit nor overfit

## Occam's Razor

The simplest solution is usually the best one.
